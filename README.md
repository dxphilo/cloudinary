## Installation and Setup

1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it:

```bash
mkdir my_fastapi_app
cd my_fastapi_app
```
# .env
```
APP_NAME = "YourAppName"
PORT = 8000
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = "YourCloudinaryCloudName"
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET = "YourCloudinaryApiSecret"
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY = "YourCloudinaryApiKey"
```

Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended) to isolate your project dependencies:

```
python3 -m venv venv
```
For macOS/Linux:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

For Windows:

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```
install dependencies

```
pip install 
```
Run the application
```
python3 main.py 
```
